* MPV-CONTROL README
This is proof of concept project to control mpv by Common Lisp.

* MSYS2 verions of mpv
I use the msys2 version of mpv in my initial test.

* Simple-inferiors
I had used Simple-Inferiors to run processes in other projects so I am using it here.

* Windowsisms and Unixisms
mpv has Windows and Unix releases as does Emacs.
I have found software components written for Emacs emms-player-mpv which fail on Windows.
